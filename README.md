# PortfolioWebsite

This is a personal website I am currently developing myself.
It currently contains the following tabs:
* About Me - Details about myself and what the site is about
* Projects - Contains all of the projects I have worked on so far
* Resume - A more stylish looking version of my Resume

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.2.4.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
